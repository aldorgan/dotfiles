1. Install needed packages to build the software

sudo apt-get install git devscripts equivs

2. Clone latest mpv software and cd into that directory

git clone https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv-build.git

cd mpv-build

3. Make sure everything is up-to-date

./update -j4

(optional) In the future, to update the package and files start back at step 4 and issue the following, then continue through steps 5 on.

./rebuild -j4

4. Create and install a dummy package that pulls in all needed dependencies

(The first command removes any previous .deb, if compiled previously)

rm -f mpv-build-deps_*_*.deb

mpv-build-deps -s sudo -i

5. Finally, build and then install the created deb of mpv, which will be located one directory higher

dpkg-buildpackage -uc -us -b -j4

Example created deb: mpv_0.15.0_amd64.deb

Install the created deb (might be named differently!) with dpkg -i:

sudo dpkg -i ../mpv_0.15.0_amd64.deb

Done.
