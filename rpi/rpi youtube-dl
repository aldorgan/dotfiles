To install youtube-dl I suggest you install it through pip like so:

sudo apt-get install python-pip 

sudo pip install youtube-dl

create a script called "ytcli" in /usr/local/bin

sudo nano /usr/local/bin/ytcli

And paste this inside it:

#!/bin/bash
omxplayer -o hdmi $(youtube-dl -g "$1")

Save it with ctrl+x and run

chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ytcli

The script is executable now, all you need to do is to logout and login once and now you can write

ytcli link.to.youtube.video.or.twitch.stream
