MULTILIB

If you want to use a multilib system, you can automatically configure the
multilib repository in slackpkgplus.conf and install multilib simply by running:
# /usr/doc/slackpkg+-*/setupmultilib.sh

To configure multilib manually (e.g. if you have installed multilib already),
uncomment the correct "MIRRORPLUS['multilib']=...",
and uncomment "PKGS_PRIORITY=( multilib )".
If you do not plan to build yourself 32bit packages on your 64bit machine, you may
avoid to install gcc:

   PKGS_PRIORITY=( patches:gcc slackware64:gcc multilib )


To install multilib manually, launch:
# slackpkg update gpg
# slackpkg update
# slackpkg upgrade-all
# slackpkg install multilib

After that, you can keep multilib up-to-date by launching:
# slackpkg update
# slackpkg upgrade-all
periodically lauch
# slackpkg install multilib
to check for new multilib packages availability

To uninstall multilib, you must remove 'multilib' from PKGS_PRIORITY and from
REPOPLUS, but do NOT delete the related MIRRORPLUS line, then launch:
# slackpkg update
# slackpkg remove multilib
Note: this does NOT remove the core multilib packages, because they affect the
64bit system. You must remove these by launching:
# slackpkg upgrade-all
then delete or comment the related MIRRORPLUS line, and finally launch
# slackpkg update

or just re-run
# /usr/doc/slackpkg+-*/setupmultilib.sh
